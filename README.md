# Data Science
### This repository contains two different projects related to machine learning:

## SVR Web App for Prediction
- This project explores the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for prediction. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment of the model as a web application for production
  
## RandomForest Travel Product Prediction
- This project uses Random Forest algorithm for predicting travel product preferences. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

### Both projects aim to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems.
